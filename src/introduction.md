# The Research Software Security Book

Welcome to the Research Software Security Book!

This book was born as part of a project to develop more material about writing secure software as part of a the [Software Sustainability Institute's Fellowship programme](https://software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme).

This project aims to:
- Explain why software security is important for research codes
- Identify common software security anti-patterns
- Showcase security best practices with examples

## Get involved

This project is a work-in-progress and welcomes contributions as described in our [contributing guidelines](#).
